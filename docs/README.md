## Project Management Processes Overview

OctoAcme projects follow a structured five-phase lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective & Continuous Improvement. Each phase features decision gates and specific deliverables, beginning with a Project One-pager to validate business needs, define goals, and align stakeholders. The Planning phase transforms this alignment into actionable backlogs, defined milestones, and explicit acceptance criteria, ensuring cross-team commitment before development starts.

Roles are well-defined to support effective collaboration. Product Managers own vision, prioritize the backlog, and measure outcomes. Project Managers drive delivery, maintain the risk register, facilitate syncs, and coordinate stakeholder updates. Developers implement features and uphold code quality; QA/Testers ensure solutions meet acceptance standards. This clarity around responsibilities enables transparent, focused teamwork.

Day-to-day work is managed through daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and transparent project boards (with standardized columns for triage and flow). Quality assurance is built in: unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are run in CI, and feature readiness is always validated before release. Blockers are escalated via a documented, multi-level path—team, PM/Product Lead, and then sponsor level.

Risk management and improvement are continuous. Teams proactively update their risk registers, conduct readiness reviews before any release, and rely on smoke tests and clear rollback plans to protect production. After each milestone or major release, retrospectives capture actionable learnings, with improvements tracked to completion in follow-ups. This closed loop consistently raises OctoAcme’s standard of project delivery and embeds a culture of learning and psychological safety.
